            <p>Project: Scratch Project
               Course: CSP(Computer Science Principles)
               Duration: 2 weeks (September 2019)
               Objective: Create an interactive story for a user to breeze through without any difficulty.
      Type of Project: Partner Project.                     For the Scratch project, we had to create an interactive story with a prince as our main character. At each stage the prince would have two options until the final screen. Based on what choice they chose, the story path changes. Another major resposibility both my partner and I had was doing the documentation, which was adding comments for all of our code, updating our daily log, and doing the other parts of the digital notebook that the assignment required us to do. One skill that I learned from my mistake on that project was how to effectively manage my time. This is because I saved all my work until the last minute, which really hurt my grade. However, I learned from this experience, which is why for my App Inventor project (which I will be explaining next) I planned out everything little by little so I wouldn't have to face it all at once, and as a result, got a significantly higher grade on it than the last one. Another skill that I learned from this project was the impact of math on coding. Even though it was very basic math, I was shocked that programming a game in a language that everyone considers basic would require this much math. We had to estimate coordinate points, do if statements with adding different numbers, etc. I feel like seeing this got me mentally prepared for the fact that there would be much more rigorous math coming down the line for me in programming.

            <p>Project:MIT App Inventor
               Course: CSP(Computer Science Principles)
               Duration: 2-3 weeks (October 2019)
               Objective: Copy the code from the mini golf tutorial and then make advanced features using our own code.
               Type of Project: Partner Project.

               For my MIT App Inventor project, we chose mini golf because it was a tutorial of intermediate difficulty, and we didn't want to choose something we weren't ready to handle. We chose mini golf because out of the intermediate options we were considering, we thought mini golf was the most fun. My partner and I had exceptional chemistry; we exchanged numbers and had friendly conversations, not just keeping it project related. I think this friendship bond rather than project partners bond is what helped us finish work when we wanted to finish and not have miscommunication and one person not understanding what to do. One mistake I made in this project which I will be sure to never repeat again is that I didn't fill in the daily log when I was supposed to, and saved it until the end, and it was really difficult because I couldn't remember what happened each day. Another thing I really learned about in this project is the connection in App Inventor between the design windown and the actual code. It took some time to understand, and I had to ask my partner for help using the design window, but eventually I got a decent understanding of it.
